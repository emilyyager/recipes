		<p>To make a vegetarian version of this soup, substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth.</p>

			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>2 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
					<li>2 pounds broccoli, florets roughly chopped into 1-inch 
					pieces, stems trimmed, peeled, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick 
					slices</li>
					<li>1 medium onion, roughly chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
					<li>2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic 
					press (about 2 teaspoons)</li>
					<li>1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard powder</li>
					<li>Pinch cayenne pepper</li>
					<li>Table salt</li>
					<li>3â€“4 cups water</li>
					<li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
					<li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth (see note)</li>
					<li>2 ounces baby spinach (2 loosely packed cups)</li>
					<li>3 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (3/4 cup)</li>
					<li>1 1/2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated fine (about 3/4 
					cup), plus extra for serving</li>
					<li>Ground black pepper</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Directions</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Heat butter in large Dutch oven over medium-high 
					heat. When foaming subsides, add broccoli, onion, garlic, 
					dry mustard, cayenne, and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring 
					frequently, until fragrant, about 6 minutes.</li>
					<li>Add 1 cup water and baking soda. Bring to simmer, cover, 
					and cook until broccoli is very soft, about 20 minutes, 
					stirring once during cooking.</li>
					<li>Add broth and 2 cups water and increase heat to 
					medium-high. When mixture begins to simmer, stir in spinach 
					and cook until wilted, about 1 minute.</li>
					<li> Transfer half of soup 
					to blender, add cheddar and Parmesan, and process until 
					smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
					<li>Transfer soup to medium bowl and 
					repeat with remaining soup.</li>
					<li> Return soup to Dutch oven, place 
					over medium heat and bring to simmer. Adjust consistency of 
					soup with up to 1 cup water.</li>
					<li> Season to taste with salt and 
					pepper. Serve, passing extra Parmesan separately.</li>
