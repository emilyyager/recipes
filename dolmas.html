	<body><h1>Dolmas</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
 
<ul>
	<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
	<li>2 onions, minced</li>
	<li>1 1/2 cups uncooked white rice</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons dried currants</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>1 (8 ounce) jar grape leaves, drained and rinsed</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>

<li>Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.</li>

<li>Sauté onions until tender.</li>

<li>Stir in rice and hot water to cover.</li>

<li>Cover and simmer until rice is half cooked, about 10 minutes.</li>

<li>Remove from heat and stir in tomato paste, currants, pine nuts, cinnamon, mint leaves, dill weed, allspice and cumin. Let mixture cool.</li>

<li>Prepare a large pot by placing an inverted plate on the bottom; this protects the dolmas from direct heat when steaming.</li>

<li>Rinse grape leaves in warm water; drain and cut off any stems.</li>

<li>Place about 1 teaspoon of the cooled rice mixture in the center of a leaf.</li>

<li>Fold in the sides and then roll into a cigar shape. Place in prepared pot.</li>

<li>Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>

<li>Pour in just enough warm water to reach the bottom of the first layer of dolmas.</li>

<li>Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, or until rice is totally cooked.</li>

<li>Check the water level often and add more as necessary.</li>

</ol>





<h1>Another Recipe for Dolmas</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
 
<ul>
	<li>3 cups of long grain rice</li>
	<li>3/4 tablespoon of allspice (ground)</li>
	<li>1 lb. of finely minced lamb</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon of ground pepper</li>
	<li>1 cup of tomato sauce</li>
	<li>2 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
	<li>1 lb. of grape leaves (canned or raw)</li>

	<li>large diced onion</li>
	<li>Water</li>
	<li>2 lemons</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Directions</h2>

Grape Leaves

  Prepare the leaves. If you are using raw grape leaves, you will have to prepare them. To prepare raw grape leaves, bring half a gallon of water to a boil and add salt to it. Put the grape leaves in the boiling water for about 15 min. take them off carefully, put them in a cold water bath, and let them soak. Other wise, go directly to mix preparation.

The Mix

  Prepare the filling. In a mixing bowl, mix together the rice, tomato paste, allspice, black pepper, garlic, meat, onion, and 1/4 cup of water. Keep mixing until all the ingredients are well distributed (see picture).


Fill the grape leaf. Take about a teaspoon of the mix and put it on the middle of the grape leaf. Then, spread the mix evenly as a half a cylinder. Remember to leave about 1/4 inch space from each end of the leaf. This will make folding the leaf easier. Now, fold from the stem end of the leaf. Then, tuck in the empty sides toward the center. After that, keep folding until you have a completer roll of a grape leaf(see picture). Repeat the folding procedure on the rest of the mix. Finally, start laying the rolled grape leaves in a pot. make sure you lay them close to each other.

Cook. Put the pot on a stove and pour about 2 cups of water in the pot. Then, spread the butter evenly on the top of grape leaves. Cover the pot with its lid and cook on high for about two hours. Usually, the cooking time depends on the stove and the material of the pot. However, cooking can be about one hour and fifteen minutes after the mix has come to a boil. After the cooking is done, turn off the stove and let stand uncovered for about 10 minutes.


Serving Suggestion  Serve. On a serving plate, take out one grape leaf at a time and arrange them as desired. Preferably, Dolmas are served hot.
