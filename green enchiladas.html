	<li>Remove papery husks from tomatillos and rinse well.</li>

	<li>Oven Roasting Method: Cut the tomatillos in half and place cut side down 
	on a foil-lined baking sheet. Place under a broiler for about 5-7 minutes to 
	lightly blacken the skin.</li>

	<li>Pan Roasting Method Coat the bottom of a skillet with a little vegetable oil. Heat on high heat. Place the tomatillos in the pan and sear on one side, then flip over and brown on the other side. Remove from heat.
2c Boiling Method Place tomatillos in a saucepan, cover with water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove tomatillos with a slotted spoon.</li>

	<li>Place tomatillos, lime juice, onions, cilantro, chili peppers, sugar in a blender or food processor and pulse until all ingredients are finely chopped and mixed. Season to taste with salt. Cool in refrigerator.

<h2>Ingredients for enchiladas</h2>


<ul>
	<li>shredded chicken</li>
	<li>Mexican cotija cheese or queso fresco</li>
	<li>sour cream</li>
	<li>monterrey jack cheese for topping</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions for enchiladas</h2>

<ol>
	<li>ut the chicken in a bowl and add 1/3 to a 1/2 cup of the tomatillo sauce to the chicken. Taste the chicken; if it needs salt, add a little.</li>

	<li>4 Heat a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan on medium high heat. Add a tortilla to the pan and use a metal spatula to flip it to the other side. Place another tortilla on top of this one (to soak up the excess oil) and flip again. When the tortillas are heated through, remove them to a plate lined with paper towel. Add a little more oil to the pan, and add another couple tortillas. Continue to heat through and soften all of the tortillas. Note that if you are using just made homemade tortillas you can skip this step because the tortillas are already hot, softened, and ready to eat.</li>
 
<li>4 Warm the oven to 200°F. Dip a tortilla in the salsa verde tomatillo sauce and place it on an oven-proof serving dish. Scoop a spoonful of chicken into the center of the tortilla and roll up the tortilla. Place on the serving dish and repeat with all of the tortillas. Put into the warm oven to keep the enchiladas warm while you finish the sauce.</li>

<li>5 Heat the salsa verde sauce again until simmering, then remove from heat. Stir in the sour cream until well blended. Remove the warming enchiladas from the oven and pour salsa verde sauce over all of them. Top with chopped onion, cheese, and cilantro.</li>

<li>Serve immediately. Serve with extra garnishes of onion, cheese, and cilantro on the side.</li>
