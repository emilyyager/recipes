		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
				<li>4 onions, sliced</li>
				<li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
				<li>2 bay leaves</li>
				<li>2 fresh thyme sprigs</li>
				<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
				<li>1 cup red wine, about 1/2 bottle</li>
				<li>3 heaping tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>2 quarts beef broth</li>
				<li>1 baguette, sliced</li>
				<li>1/2 pound grated Gruyere</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Melt the stick of butter in a large pot over medium heat. 
				Add the onions, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and salt and pepper 
				and cook until the onions are very soft and caramelized, about 
				25 minutes. Add the wine, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and 
				simmer until the wine has evaporated and the onions are dry, 
				about 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Dust 
				the onions with the flour and give them a stir. Turn the heat 
				down to medium low so the flour doesn't burn, and cook for 10 
				minutes to cook out the raw flour taste. Now add the beef broth, 
				bring the soup back to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes. 
				Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.</li>

				<li>When you're ready to eat, preheat the broiler. Arrange the 
				baguette slices on a baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle 
				the slices with the Gruyere and broil until bubbly and golden 
				brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>

				<li>Ladle the soup in bowls and float several of the Gruyere 
				croutons on top.</li>

				<li>Alternative method: Ladle the soup into bowls, top each with 
				2 slices of bread and top with cheese. Put the bowls into the 
				oven to toast the bread and melt the cheese.</li>							
			</ul>
