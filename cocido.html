<ul>
	<li>The main ingredient of cocido is the chickpea or garbanzo bean, 
	preferably of its larger variety (also known as kabuli). Vegetables are 
	added: potatoes mainly, but also cabbage, carrots, and turnips. In some 
	cases, green bean, mangold andcardoon is also added.</li>
	<li>The meat used is fundamentally pork: pork belly, usually fresh, but 
	sometimes cured (some purists even insist to a point of rancidity); fresh 
	(unsmoked) chorizo;onion morcilla, and dried and cured jam√≥n serrano. Beef 
	shank is also added; the fat content (flor) of the piece is highly prized. 
	Chicken (specially old hens) is also part of the cocido.</li>
	<li>Two bone pieces (ham bone and beef spine bone) are added to enrich the 
	stock.</li>
	<li>The final touch is the bola, a meatball-like mix of ground beef, bread 
	crumbs,parsley and other spices, which, it is said, was created as a 
	substitute of the eggs used in the adafaina.</li>
