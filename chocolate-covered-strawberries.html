<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
	<li>6 to 9 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
	<li>1 pound strawberries with stems (about 20), washed and dried very well</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>

	<li>Put the semisweet and chocolates into a heatproof medium bowl.</li>

	<li>Fill a medium saucepan with a couple inches of water and bring to a simmer over medium heat.</li>

	<li>Turn off the heat; set the bowl of chocolate over the water to melt. Stir until smooth. (Alternatively, melt the chocolates in a microwave at half power, for 1 minute, stir and then heat for another minute or until melted.)</li>

	<li>Once the chocolate is melted and smooth, remove from the heat. Line a sheet pan with parchment or waxed paper. Holding the strawberry by the stem, dip the fruit into the dark chocolate, lift and twist slightly, letting any excess chocolate fall back into the bowl. Set strawberries on the parchment paper. Repeat with the rest of the strawberries.</li>
	
	<li>Set the strawberries aside until the chocolate sets, about 30 minutes.</li>

</ol>
