<h3>Source: <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/indianeggplantbhurtha/Detail.aspx"><i>All Recipes</i></a></h3>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
 
<ul>
	<li>1 eggplant</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
	<li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger ← didn’t include this first time June 2011</li>
	<li>1 large tomato peeled, seeded and diced</li>
	<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
	<li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
	<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>

<li>Preheat the oven's broiler. Rub oil on the outside of the egg plant, or coat with cooking spray. Place under the broiler, and cook until the flesh is soft and the skin is blistering off, about 30 minutes. Turn as needed for even cooking. Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise, and scoop the flesh out of the skin. Discard the skin; chop up the flesh, and set aside.<li>

<li>Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds, and let them crackle for a few seconds and turn golden brown. Be careful not to burn them. Add the onion, ginger and garlic; cook and stir until tender. I don't let the onions get very brown. Stir in the tomato, and season with turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper. Cook and stir for a few minutes.</li>

<li>Place the eggplant pieces in the skillet, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes so some of the moisture evaporates. Taste, and adjust seasonings if desired. Garnish with fresh cilantro, and serve.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>

<li>Variation: You can also add peas to this dish. Stir in 1/2 cup of frozen peas when you are simmering the tomatoes.</li>

</ul>
