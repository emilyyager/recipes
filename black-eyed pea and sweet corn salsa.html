Black-Eyed Pea and Sweet Corn Salsa
Serves 8
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
	<li>1 cup dried black-eyed peas, picked over and rinsed, soaked overnight and drained</li>
	<li>3 cups of water</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1 Tablespoon of olive oil</li>
	<li>1/2 yellow onion, chopped</li>
	<li>1/2 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
	<li>1 cup fresh corn kernels (cut from about 2 ears corn)</li>
	<li>1 tomato, seeded and diced</li>
	<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
	<li>1 lime, squeezed for juice and grated for zest</li>
	<li>1 Tablespoon white wine vinegar or sherry vinegar</li>
	<li>3 Tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>


In a large saucepan over high heat, combine the peas, water, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover partially, and simmer until peas are tender, about 45 minutes. Drain the peas, rinse with cool water, drain again, and transfer to a large bowl to cool. 
In a large nonstick frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and bell pepper and sauté until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the corn, tomato and garlic and sauté until the tomato is softened and the corn is tender-crisp, about 4 minutes.
Add the corn mixture to the peas along with the lime zest and juice, vinegar, cilantro, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Toss to mix. Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
