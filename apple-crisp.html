		<h1>Apple Crisp</h1>

			<h3>Directions</h3>
			
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 375. Have ready an unbuttered 2-inch deep 
		2-quart baking dish.</li>

		<li>Peel, core, and cut into 1-inch chunks 8 medium apples (about 2.5 	
		pounds).</li>
		
		<li>Spread the apple chunks evenly in the baking dish.</li>

		<li>In a bowl, combine:
			<ul>
				<li>3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
				<li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
				<li>(1/4 teaspoon grated or ground nutmeg)</li>
			</ul>	
		</li>

		<li>To the bowl, add 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 
		small pieces.</li>

		<li>Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the butter into the dry 
		ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. (This may 
		also be done with a mixer or in a food processor, taking care not to 
		blend the butter too thoroughly.) Scatter the topping evenly over the 
		fruit. Bake until the topping is golden brown, the juices are bubbling, 
		and the apples are tender, 50 to 55 minutes. Serve hot or cold.</li>
	</ol>
