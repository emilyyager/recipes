		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>3 pounds russet potatoes (about 6 potatoes)
				<li>3/4 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
				<li>2 1/4 tablespoons cider vinegar
				<li>2 large eggs
				<li>1/4 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons Homemade Mayonnaise, or prepared
				<li>1/4 teaspoon celery seed
				<li>3/4 teaspoon dry mustard [1 1/2 Tablespoon mustard]
				<li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
				<li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1/4-inch dice (3/4 cup)
				<li>3/4 red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch dice (1/2 cup)
				<li>3/4 medium onion, finely diced (1/2 cup)
				<li>8 cornichons/gherkins/pickles, cut into 1/4-inch dice (1/4 cup)
				<li>2 green onion, thinly sliced (1/2 cup)
				<li>1 1/2 tablespoons freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley
				<li>3/4 teaspoon paprika
			</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover by 
				several inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, add 3/4 tablespoon 
				salt, and lower to a gentle boil. Cook until potatoes are tender 
				when pierced with a knife, about 25 minutes. Drain into a 
				colander. Using paper towels or gloves to protect your hands, 
				peel potatoes, and cut into 1-inch dice while still hot. Drizzle 
				with vinegar; set aside.</li>

				<li>Place eggs in a small pan with enough water to cover by 1 
				inch, and place over medium-high heat. When water comes to a 
				boil, turn off heat, cover, and let stand for 13 minutes. Drain, 
				and place in a bowl with cold water to cover. When cold, peel 
				eggs. Chop into 1/4-inch dice.</li>

				<li>Combine diced eggs, mayonnaise, celery seed, mustard, 2 
				teaspoons salt, and black pepper in a large bowl, and whisk to 
				combine. Add reserved potatoes to mayonnaise mixture. Add 
				celery, red pepper, onion, cornichons, scallions, and chopped 
				parsley. Stir to combine. Chill for 30 minutes before serving. 
				Garnish with paprika and reserved hard-boiled egg rounds.</li>
			</ol>
