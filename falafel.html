<h2>Ingredients</h2>
 
<ul>
	<li>1 cup dried chickpeas</li>
	<li>1/2 large onion, roughly chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1/21 teaspoon dried hot red pepper</li>
	<li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	<li>46 tablespoons flour</li>
	<li>Soybean or vegetable oil for frying</li>
	<li>Chopped tomato for garnish</li>
	<li>Diced onion for garnish</li>
	<li>Diced green bell pepper for garnish</li>
	<li>Tahina sauce</li>
	<li>Pita bread</li>
</ul> 
<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>

<li>1. Put the chickpeas in a large bowl and add enough cold water to cover them by at least 2 inches. Let soak overnight, then drain. Or use canned chickpeas, drained.</li>

<li>2. Place the drained, uncooked chickpeas and the onions in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the parsley, cilantro, salt, hot pepper, garlic, and cumin. Process until blended but not pureed.</li>

<li>3. Sprinkle in the baking powder and 4 tablespoons of the flour, and pulse. You want to add enough bulgur or flour so that the dough forms a small ball and no longer sticks to your hands. Turn into a bowl and refrigerate, covered, for several hours.</li>

<li>4. Form the chickpea mixture into balls about the size of walnuts, or use a falafel scoop, available in Middle Eastern markets.</li>

<li>5. Heat 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees in a deep pot or wok and fry 1 ball to test. If it falls apart, add a little flour. Then fry about 6 balls at once for a few minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Stuff half a pita with falafel balls, chopped tomatoes, onion, green pepper, and pickled turnips. Drizzle with tahini thinned with water.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Egyptians omit the cilantro and substitute fava beans for the 
	chickpeas.</li>

	<li>Tahina (also called tahini) is an oily paste made from ground sesame 
	seeds. It is available in Middle Eastern markets.</li>

	<li>To garnish your falafel in true Israeli style, try adding one or several 
	of the following condiments:<li>

	<ul>
		<li>harissa hot sauce</li>
		<li>pickled turnip</li>
		<li>mango amba (pickle)</li>
		<li>sauerkraut</li>
	</ul>
	
</ul>
