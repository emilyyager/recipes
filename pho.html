<h2>Ingredients&nbsp;&ndash; Cheater's Asian Broth</h2>

<ul>
	<li>1 medium onion, thin sliced</li>
	<li>4 large cloves garlic, thin sliced</li>
	<li>2- to 3-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and thin sliced</li>
	<li>6 whole cloves</li>
	<li>1 star anise, bruised, or 1/2 teaspoon anise seed</li>
	<li>Fresh-ground black pepper</li>
	<li>4 cans low sodium chicken stock, or regular chicken broth</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons Asian fish sauce</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ingredients&nbsp;&ndash; Soup</h2>

<ul>
	<li>6 to 8 ounces linguine-style rice noodles</li>
	<li>6 to 8 ounces top round steak (chicken breast can be substituted), sliced extremely thin (see Cook to Cook)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ingredients&nbsp;&ndash; Table Salad</h2>

<ul>
	<li>10 branches fresh coriander</li>
	<li>6 to 8 branches Thai, or other basil</li>
	<li>2 serrano or jalapeno chiles, thin sliced</li>
	<li>Generous handful bean sprouts</li>
	<li>1 large lime, cut into wedges</li>
	<li>Hoisin sauce</li>
	<li>Hot sauce</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>

<li>Position an oven rack 4 to 6 inches from the broiler, and preheat. Double up a very large piece of heavy foil. Scatter on the foil the onion, garlic, ginger, cloves, anise, and 5 grinds of pepper. Broil for 5 minutes, turning the pieces once. You want the onion to have some toasted edges, and the spices should be fragrant. Scrape everything into a 6-quart pot. Be sure to get all the anise seed.</li>

<li>Add the broth, sugar, and fish sauce, bring to a gentle bubble, cover tightly, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>

<li>Put the rice noodles in a large bowl, and cover them with very hot tap water. (To keep them hot, cover the bowl with a plate.) Soak the noodles for 10 to 15 minutes or until they are tender, but with a little more firmness than you want. Stir a few times. When ready, drain and rinse well with cold water. Divide the noodles between 2 large soup bowls.</li>

<li>As the broth simmers and noodles soak, arrange the table salad on a platter and set out the sauces. To serve, divide the beef between the soup bowls. Ladle the bubbling broth into the bowls. Top each serving with a few sprigs of the coriander and serve.</li>

</ol>
