		<div>Serves 4</div>		
		<div>Pairs perfectly with summer melons like honeydew.</div>

		<h2>Ingredients for the peaches:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>2 lb. ripe Texas peaches</li>
				<li>¼ c. cane sugar</li>
				<li>Zest and juice of 1 lemon</li>
				<li>Pinch salt</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Ingredients for the ch&egrave;vre</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1 c. CKC fresh chèvre</li>
				<li>2 T. Texas honey</li>
				<li>Pepper, to taste</li>
				<li>Splash milk, if needed</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
			<ol>

<li>Wash, peel (with a peeler or sharp paring knife) and halve the peaches. Remove the pit then dice the halves into large dice (they don’t have to be perfect, so don’t discard the less-than-square pieces). Combine with the sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar—stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and strain the liquid back into the pan—reserving the fruit in a separate bowl. Bring the liquid back to a boil and reduce to a syrup that holds its shape when you pull a spatula through it (like Moses parting the Red Sea). Pour the liquid over the reserved fruit and put the bowl over an ice bath to cool rapidly.</li>

<li>In the bowl of a mixer, combine the chèvre, honey and a touch of freshly ground black pepper. Using the paddle attachment, whip the chèvre mixture on medium speed until smooth (I always add a splash of milk—either whole cow’s milk or goat’s milk—if the cheese seems a little dry. It should be easily spreadable). Reserve and refrigerate until 30 minutes before serving. Drizzle some of the juice from the peaches around each of 4 plates and divide some of the chilled chèvre and peaches onto each. Serve with buttery or nutty crackers.</li>
